 Student Association, or TSA, is a national organization spanning 
forty-nine states. It encourages its over two million members to pursue 
their interests in the STEM related fields - Science, Technology, 
Engineering, and Math. In order to do this, TSA hosts numerous 
competitions at regional, state, and national levels. These competitions
 range from traditional scientific projects, such as Engineering Design,
 Software Development, and Animatronics, to more unique ones, like 
Fashion Design, Music Production, and Video Game Design. Notable alumni 
of TSA include famous singer Carrie Underwood&nbsp;and Facebook founder 
Mark Zuckerburg.</span></span></span></p></div><div class="txtNew" id="comp-jc288qgf" style="left: 0px; width: 459px; position: absolute; top: 464px;"><h2 class="font_2">Waynesboro's TSA</h2></div><div class="txtNew" id="comp-jc2890i6" style="left: 0px; width: 478px; position: absolute; top: 640px;"><p class="font_8" style="font-size:20px;"><span style="font-size:20px;"><span class="color_15"><span style="font-family:helvetica-w01-light,helvetica-w02-light,sans-serif;">Waynesboro's
 current chapter of TSA was founded in 2014 by Mrs. Rudolph, a past 
member of TSA herself, after almost sixteen years of absence. It was 
started with only seven members, who lead the chapter to victory in 
regional and state competitions.<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">How to Join</span><br>
Students can come to a TSA meeting after school to join. However, 
students can only join TSA at the beginning of the school year, as 
competition sign-ups occur quickly after the first meetings start.<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Meetings</span><br>
TSA meets every other Thursday after school. Meetings are more regular 
at the beginning of the year when there is important information 
constantly coming in, and less frequent as the year progresses so 
members can work on their competitions independently.<br>
